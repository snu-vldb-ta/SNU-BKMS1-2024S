# Term Project: Backend Application with PostgreSQL

## Overview
This term project is designed to enhance your understanding and skills in developing backend applications using a relational database management system (RDBMS), specifically PostgreSQL. You are free to choose the topic of your application, allowing you to explore an area of personal or professional interest while integrating the core features and technologies taught during the course.

## Objectives
- **Develop a backend application** that interacts with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Implement core features** using PostgreSQL to handle data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- **Experience the full lifecycle** of backend application development, from design to deployment.
- **Utilize a programming language of your choice** to create the application, integrating the PostgreSQL database effectively.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Programming Language
- You may use **any programming language** you are comfortable with for this project (e.g., Python, Java, C++, Node.js ...).
- Python is recommended since we have covered it in the course, but you are free to choose any language.
- Ensure that the chosen language has support for integrating with PostgreSQL.

### 2. Database
- Use **PostgreSQL** as the backend database.
- Design an appropriate schema for your application's data.

### 3. Mandatory Features
You are required to implement **more than ten different features** learned during the course. <br/> 
These features may include, but are not limited to:
- SQL commands and complex queries.
- Use of joins to retrieve data from multiple tables.
- Database triggers for automated tasks.
- Views for simplifying access to data.
- Indexes to improve query performance.
- Transactions to ensure data integrity.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector-based search with traditional SQL WHERE clauses to enhance search capabilities and performance.

### 4. Code Structure
- All user scenarios and features should be coded in one file. (e.g., `main.py`, `app.js`)
- Include comments in your code to briefly explain the logic and functionality of each feature.
- Provide readme.md file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application.
- Print out logs or messages to demonstrate the execution of each feature.

### 5. Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: 100 points
- Report/Demo Video: 80 points
- Contributions: 20 points
- Total: 200 points

## Submission Guidelines
### 1. Submission Files

### 1-1 Team (One submission per team)
 
The team representative is required to submit three files (`BKMS1-team{N}-source.zip`, `BKMS1-team{N}-report.pdf`, `BKMS1-team{N}-demo.mp4`).

1. `BKMS1-team{N}-source.zip`

- Zip the source code of your application. Include all necessary files and directories required to run the application.

2. `BKMS1-team{N}-report.pdf`

- The report should include:
  - Topic and description of the application.
  - Database schema design.
  - Use case scenarios and corresponding dbms features.
  - Role of each team member in the project.
  - Development process and challenges faced.
  - Lesson learned and opinions on the project.
- Feel free to write without any page limit, but the report must be submitted in PDF format.
- The report title should follow this format: ‘BKMS1-team${N}-report.pdf’ (e.g., BKMS1-team1-report.pdf)
- Late submissions will incur a penalty of 20% of the total grade per day.

3. `BKMS1-team{N}-demo.mp4`

- Create a demo video showcasing the application's functionality.
- There is no length limit for the video, but 2-5 minutes is recommended.
- The video must demonstrate every single use case.
- Voice recording is not mandatory.
- No fancy editing is required; a simple screen recording will suffice.

### 1-2 All (Individual submission)

1. `BKMS1-team{N}-contribution-{student id}.xlsx`

   **► Use the following file: ([BKMS1-contribution.xlsx](./BKMS1-contribution.xlsx))**
   - Sum of all contributions should be 100.

### 2. Submission Folder Architecture

   The architecture of submission folder should be as follows:

   ```
   (Representative)
   BKMS1-team{N}/
       ├── BKMS1-team{N}-source.zip
       ├── BKMS1-team{N}-report.pdf
       └── BKMS1-team{N}-demo.mp4
   
   (All)
   BKMS1-team{N}-contribution-{student id}.xlsx
   ```

   **[Instructions - Representative]**

   1. Create a folder named `BKMS1-team{N}`. _Ex) BKMS1-Term-1_ <br/>
   2. Inside the `BBKMS1-team{N}` folder, place `BKMS1-team{N}-source.zip` and `BKMS1-team{N}-report.pdf` and `BKMS1-team{N}-demo.mp4` files.
   3. zip the `BKMS1-team{N}` folder.
   4. Submit the zipped folder through ETL.

   **[Instructions - All]**

   1. Submit the BKMS1-team{N}-contribution-{student id}.xlsx file through ETL.

### 3. Submission Guide

> Due Date: 2024.06.14 11:59 PM<br/>
> Where: ETL

1. Make sure to follow **submission folder instruction**.

   - -10 points if the file format(pdf, xlsx) is incorrect.
   - -10 points if the folder architecture is different compared to submission folder instruction.

2. Late submissions are penalized by **20%** of total grade per day. <br/>
3. Provide a detailed description of how to execute scenario code. <br/>
4. Download the [REPORT TEMPLATE](./report-template.docx). _(This is just a formatting example, write report in a free format.)_

### 4. Presentation

> Date: 2024.06.13 10:45 ~ 12:30 (Zoom)
> 5min presentation (+ demo video) + 2min Q&A
